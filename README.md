# face-detection
face detection using python and AIML
Hi!this is the AI/ML face detection using python ,im going to explain how the project works and want are lib want to install for this project
first importing the lib like threading,cv2,deepfance and uuid.threading module is used to run functions cocurrently in spreate theards.cv2 is used to
capturing the video,deepface is used for face recoginition,uuid is used to generate unique indentifers to capture frames,cv2_capshow is used to avoid issues
"0"is indicates default camera,counter=0 keep track on number of frames,face_match indicates whether face is match or not,reference_img_path is used for refernce image,,lock ensure theard safety when upading face match,check_face is used to takes path and capture frame as arugement,the face match is found it update variable,ret,frame = cap.read()used for loop used to capture continusouly from webcam,counter%30=0is used to reduce frequency,uuid.uuid() new theard to run check fce function,with lock inside the loop updates the displayedvideo.face match,next command used to end the program,next command used close the widows and the program exits,and this is program works.
# color detection
HI! ,this is the AI/ML project using python. in this program want to import cv2,numpy,time. cv2 to capture vision,numpy is act as numercial operators,time to handle time releated functions,color_ranges dictionary defines hsv colors this dictionary will be used to categorize the detected colors based on their hsv value  get_color_name it intertes thourgh color_range.given color compared with hsv value and color match as defined color range , the functions returns ,color name ,otherwise its shown unkown,andthen video caputre command used ,cap_read() is whether frame successfully or not,cv2.cvt color used to compare with BGR color space,last_color is used to print the detected color,wait key is used to break the loop,and anthoer two command used to close all windows ,and program will be exits,this is how program works.
# chatbot
HI! this is a mini customized chatbot program. i going to explain shortly how the chatbot works,want to import random lib and want to give the responses for if user gives input and they detect output from responses,chat_bot_responses takes user input and chatbot gives welcome message start run the program,while the true stament runs through how the user gives the imput and then output will be given from responses if any default input given ,chatbot gives default staement output ,this how chatbot works.
